# LOOK-SEE ART

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/looksee-art/art-is-scrap.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## ART IS SCRAP

```
look-see is on a mission to 

_find something in everything_
